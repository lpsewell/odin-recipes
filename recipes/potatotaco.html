    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Crispy potato tacos (tacos de papa) are crisp outside, creamy inside, and full of bold flavors. They're a real favorite around here, especially when paired with simple black bean soup. Here's how to make them great.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (454 grams) Yukon gold potatoes</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons fine sea salt, divided</li>
        <li>½ cup (120 grams) sour cream</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sweet Hungarian paprika</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 6-inch corn tortillas</li>
        <li>½ cup (120 ml) safflower oil, for frying</li>
      <li>4 ounces (113 grams) shredded extra-sharp cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>½ small red onion, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>Peel the potatoes and cut into roughly 1-inch cubes. Place in a small pot with cold water to cover and two teaspoons of the salt.</li>
     <li>Bring to a boil, then simmer for about 10 minutes, until tender.</li>
     <li>Drain and return to pot.</li>
     <li>In a small bowl, stir together the sour cream, remaining ½ teaspoon salt, onion powder, paprika, cumin, garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne.</li>
     <li>Add mixture to potatoes and mash until smooth.</li>
     <li>One by one, heat the tortillas on both sides in a dry 12-inch frying pan.
</li>
     <li>Spread a generous two tablespoons of potato into each tortilla and gently fold to form a taco.
</li>
     <li>When all tacos are assembled, heat the oil in the same frying pan until thin and shimmering.</li>
     <li>Working three to four tacos at a time, fry on one side until crisp, about 90 seconds, then flip and repeat. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with a little additional salt if you like.</li>
     <li>To serve, add some cheese, cilantro and red onion to the top of each taco (or gently open it and place inside),</li>
    </ol>
